    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the 
        presentation and design of HTML documents, controlling elements like layout,
        colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness. It separates content from visual 
        styling, allowing developers to apply consistent styles across multiple pages 
        and making websites easier to maintain and update. CSS can be applied inline, 
        internally within an HTML file, or externally through linked stylesheets, and 
        it supports a cascading system where styles can override one another based on 
        specificity and source order. It plays a crucial role in modern web development 
        by enhancing user experience and design flexibility.</p>
